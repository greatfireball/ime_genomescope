# ime_genomescope
Docker image to provide GenomeScope software

## Prerequisities

In order to run this container you'll need docker installed.

* [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/windows/started)
* [OS X](https://docs.docker.com/mac/started/)
* [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/linux/started/)

## Usage

The docker image provides the [GenomeScope](https://github.com/schatzlab/genomescope) software. It will run the `Rscript genomescope.R` command as entrypoint.
Therefore, running [GenomeScope](https://github.com/schatzlab/genomescope#running-genomescope-on-the-command-line) is as easy as:

```
docker run --rm greatfireball/ime_genomescope histogram_file k-mer_length read_length output_dir
```

Just provide all required parameters via command line.
Default working directory is `/data`.
Therefore, input data should be mounted using `/data` volume.
